# Method

## Participants

## Auditory stimuli

The stimuli were presented using the Psychopy software. The program provided instructions in spoken and written form simultaneously. Spoken instructions (duration = 35 s) were recorded in English by a 25-year-old female Spanish-English simultaneous bilingual. In the instructions, the recording did not orally mention the target words, but these were presented in written form.
The stimuli were adapted from Gonsales and Lotto (2013, 2019) and they consisted of disyllabic pseudowords containing bilabial stops in utterance initial position. The pseudowords included a continua from bafri to pafri.
The original recording included the Spanish pafri token (/paf??i/), which was stripped both of its final three sounds, (-fri), and of the voiceless initial sound, (p-), although not
including the release burst. The author selected the Spanish pa- token as the continuum's 0 ms VOT token. This original token was transformed into 7 tokens that ranged in VOT from ???35 ms to ???5ms, and from +5ms to +30 ms. All intervals lasted approximately 5 ms. The /ba-pa/ continuum's bilabial stop's VOT ranged within both Spanish and English /b-p/ intervals (Hay, 2005; Lisker
& Abramson, 1970; Williams, 1977). The Spanish /a/ segment had an English counterpart, /??/. The aforementioned Spanish and English vowels differ in backness (being central and back vowels,
respectively). However, they overlap in F1-F2 space. What is more, these vowels are perceived very similarly by Spanish-English bilinguals (Flege, Munro, & Fox, 1994).
These continua were recorded by another female Spanish-English bilingual, using the Praat software (Boersma & Weenink, 2010).
